    "**HIV is a virus that has presented an immense challenge for public health, globally**. The ensuing disease dynamics touch on multiple societal dimensions including nutrition, access to health, education and research funding. To compound the difficulties, the virus mutates rapidly with different strains having different geographic footprints. In particular, the HIV-1-C and HIV-2 strains predominate mostly in Africa. Due to disparities in funding, research for treatments of the African strains lags behind other programmes. African researchers are striving to address this imbalance and should consider adding the latest technologies such as quantum computing to their toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum computing promises spectacular improvements in drug-design**. In particular, in order to design new anti-retrovirals it is important to perform **chemical simulations** to confirm that the anti-retroviral binds with the virus protein. Such simulations are notoriously hard and sometimes ineffective on classical supercomputers. Quantum computers promise more accurate simulations allowing for a better drug-design workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail: anti-retrovirals are drugs that **bind with and block a virus protein**, **called protease**, that cleaves virus polyproteins into smaller proteins, ready for packaging. The protease can be thought of as a chemical scissor. The anti-retroviral can be thought of as a sticky obstacle that disrupts the ability of the scissor to cut. With the protease blocked, **the virus cannot make more copies of itself**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations in the viral protease changes the binding propensity of a given anti-retroviral. Hence, when a mutation occurs and an anti-retroviral no longer binds well, the goal becomes to adjust the anti-retroviral molecule to again bind strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main goal of this challenge is to explore whether a toy anti-retroviral molecule binds with a toy virus protease.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, this challenge introduces **state-of-the-art hybrid classical-quantum embedded chemistry modelling** allowing the splitting of the work-load between classical approximations and more accurate quantum calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to tweak the setup of the quantum chemistry algorithm (without having to understand the nuts and bolts of quantum computing) to achieve the best performance for ideal quantum computing conditions."

The reason for this is that in our above treatment there are sources of modelling error including: the placement of nuclei and a number of approximations that come with the Hartree-Fock expansion. For $H_2$ these can be addressed, but ultimately, in general, the more tricky of these sources can never be fully handled because finding the perfect ground-state is QMA-complete, i.e. the quantum version of NP-complete (i.e. 'unsolvable' for certain Hamiltonians). Then again, nature itself is not expected to be finding this perfect ground-state, so future experimention is needed to see how close a given quantum computing solution approximates nature's solution."

If the ball is not rolling too fast down the plateau (right to left) it may settle in the valley. The ball slowly rolls down the plateau because the slope is positive (representing a force of attraction between the two hydrogen atoms). If the ball overshoots the minimum point of the valley, it meets the steep negative slope of the mountain and quickly rolls back (the hydrogen atoms repell each other).\n",
